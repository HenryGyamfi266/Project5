# Project Overview
This project is a Python GUI application called "Photo Library Report" that processes a data file using control break logic to produce a yearly summary report of file metadata.
It reads the file, extracts the creation date, filename, and byte size, and calculates total bytes per year. The report is displayed on the screen and saved to an HTML file for easy viewing in a web browser.
Error handling ensures that the program manages file issues gracefully. The project demonstrates skills in GUI design, file handling, and data processing.
